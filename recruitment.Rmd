<say>Hi, may I speak with [MOM]?
My name is [CALLER NAME] and I’m calling from [LAB] about a home study where we're looking at how moms and children interact with each other. We'd be visitng your home and you'd receive $25 at the end of the visit for your participation. Can we tell you about it?
First, I have some questions to see if you and [CHILD] qualify for the study. 

<say> Does [CHILD]have any siblings?</say>

- → *If yes: **end call**.* <say>In this study, we are currently looking for only-children. Would it be alright if we contacted you for other studies in the future?</say>
- → *If no: continue*

<say>What language(s) do you speak to [CHILD]?</say>

- → *If not ENGLISH or SPANISH: **end call**.* <say>To control for differences in communication, we are looking for families who speak mainly English or Spanish. Would it be alright if we contacted you for other studies in the future?</say>
- → *If mainly English/Spanish: continue*

<say>Was [CHILD] born on his/her due date? (If not: “How many weeks and days early/late was he/she?”)<say>

- → *If more than 4 weeks early: **end call**.* <say>In this study, we are currently looking for children born on term. Would it be alright if we contacted you for other studies in the future?<say>
- → *If born on term (37-41 weeks): continue*

<say>Has [CHILD] been diagnosed with any disability (cognitive, auditory, vision, motor)?</say> 

- → *If yes: **end call**.* <say>In this study, we are looking for typically developing children. Would it be alright if we contacted you for other studies in the future?</say> 
- → *If no: continue*

<say>For this study, we are interested in learning about children’s natural, everyday experiences in their homes. A researcher will visit you and [CHILD] in your home for about 2.5 hours. You and [CHILD] will be video recorded for 1 hour as you go about your day, followed by questions on [CHILD]'s skills and routines. We will ask you to take us through your home as we record the environment. For your participation, we will compensate you with $25 at the end of the session.
The data collected in this study are valuable and will be placed in a secure web-based library available only to researchers. The purpose is to share the data with experts in the field so that scientists can learn more about infant development.
Does this sound like something you would be interested in participating in with [CHILD]?</say>

- → *If no to study or to sharing video on Databrary: **end call** * <say>Okay, thank you. May we call you for other studies?</say>
- → *If yes: continue* 

<say>Great! Because we are interested in mother-infant routines, we'd like to find a time and date when we can observe just <span style="text-decoration:underline">**you and [CHILD]**</span> at home. It would be great if we can schedule a time that is not during a typical mealtime and when [CHILD] is usually awake. Is there a convenient time and day that works best for you that would be within these criteria?</say>

- → *If the date they are available puts child out of age range: **end call** * <say>For this study, we are interested in studying specific age groups: 12-, 18-, and 23-month olds. Would it be possible for us to contact you in XX months to see if [CHILD] can participate then?</say>
- → *If dates are available when child is still within eligible age range: continue*

<say>Before the study, we have a few questions that we'd like to ask. It should only take about 5 minutes. We can either ask you now or when we call to confirm the study. What would you prefer?</say>

- → *If ready to answer now, continue*:
    - On your tablet, open Kobo toolbox and start a new questionnaire set
    - Fill out participant information at top of new session
    - “Save as Draft” after Phone Questionnaire and home visit questionnaires
    - Only hit “Submit” after filling out clean-up notes back in lab
    - [List of questions on the Phone Questionnaire](https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/254/slot/15048/-/asset/63741)
    - *Please note that presentation and format will differ in the app.*
- → *If not available now* <say>When will be a good time to call back about the questions?</say>
    - If another time work, schedule a 5-minute call to complete phone questionnaire
    - If difficult to find a time up to 2 days before visit, complete phone questionnaire when confirming visit

<say>So I have you and [CHILD] for our study on [DATE] at [TIME]. We'll be calling you the day before (if study is on Monday: the Friday before) your appointment to confirm that that time still works for you. Have a great day!</say>  

<br>

The visit lasts about 3 hours, and you will receive a $50 Visa gift card at the end of the session.

### 4.2 Prepare

1. Take your own water with you. For the duration of the visit, you will decline any offerings of food or drink.
2. Take your university ID with you, be prepared to show it if asked.  
3. Dress plainly, modestly, neutrally. Nothing too bright and attractive to children. Try not to wear all black either :) 
4. Avoid strong perfumes and noisy jewelry. The idea is to blend into the background as much as possible.
5. Be prepared to plan your bathroom breaks around the visit (it will be approx 2.5 hrs long).
