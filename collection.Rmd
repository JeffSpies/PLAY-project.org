# Collection overview

The collaborating sites in PLAY perform a variety of roles (see [people](people.html) for details). Each site that performs a **collecting** role is pre-assigned to complete all of the collecting functions (see in blue below). This page contains detailed help for the data collection and upload process. Click here for information about <a href="participants.html"><font color="#5B9BD5"><b> participant recruitment </b></font></a> .

<img src="img/overview-collecting.png" width="600">


All videos that are collected with go through a quality assurance process in which the PLAY team will ensure that the videos are eligible to be included in the final sample. Videos that pass QA will then be passed on for coding. Videos that don't pass QA will be (depending on why they didn't) reused for other purposes or will be sent back to the collection site for modification. In some cases, the collection site might be provided additional training.

# Home Visit

<!-- *(Please ensure that you have read through the [participants](participants.html) page before you continue)* -->

Now that you have set your target participant sample and completed all the steps listed in the [recruitment](recruitment.html) process, these instructions will help you prepare for your participant home visit. <br><br>

<div class = "bluebg">
Please ensure that you are  [**currently logged in at Databrary**](https://nyu.databrary.org/user/login) to view protected content in this webpage. <i> For confidentiality reasons, access to video exemplars is restricted to researchers with authorized access to [Databrary](http://databrary.org). To register for access, visit <http://databrary.org/register>. </i>  
</div>


<br>

At the end of data collection, you will upload _exactly 4 videos_ to your Databrary repository:  

1. One-hour naturalistic play (include: decibel measure, shoes _if child is wearing them in the house_)
2. House walkthrough (include: measurements of each room, sleeping arrangements, clothing, books, toys, shoes _if child is barefoot_)
3. 5-min structured play (focus on child and mom, even if they leave mat area)
4. Questionnaires (set up camera on tripod, focus on mom)
<br>

## 1. Arrival introduction

- Ask if you should take your shoes off. Ask for good place to place backpack and coat.
- Do not leave the tripod and other equipment lying around.
- Do not engage or warm up to the baby. Just need to make mom feel comfortable.

Say: <say>Thanks for letting us come to your home. The visit has a few parts.  
I’ll begin by video-recording you and [CHILD] as you go about your day. I will video-record you both for 1 hour. Then, I will ask [CHILD] to play with some toys both by him/herself and with you. <br>
Afterwards, I will ask you some general questions about your family and home, and about [CHILD]’s skills and routines.  
You will give me a walk-through of your home that I will record on video to get a sense of the places [CHILD] goes and things that he/she plays with. <br>
Do you have any questions? Let’s start with reading and signing the consent.</say>
<br><br>

## 2. Consent to participate, permission to share

Ask mom to review the following forms. When finished, give her a moment to look over each form and sign them.

1. [Databrary Release Language](https://databrary.org/access/policies/release-template.html) form asking for consent to participate in the study.
 
2. [Databrary form](https://www.databrary.org/policies/release-template.pdf) form asking for permission to share videos and metadata.  

Here are [videos](https://databrary.org/access/guide/investigators/release/asking/examples.html) that depict how to ask for permission to share and a [sample script](https://databrary.org/access/guide/investigators/release/asking/script.html). <br><br>


## 3. One-hour natural play video & noise measurement  

- Aim to get 60 minutes of natural play recoding, in addition to the time you take to record the decibel meter and shoes.
- Always try to stay toward the edge of rooms and doorways. You do not want to influence child to interact with you, or get in child's way.
- Anytime mom asks to turn off camera, do so and add that time to reach 60 mins of recording.

### 3.1 Decibel Meter

When you are ready to record the one-hour natural play, hold the video camera in one hand, point it to the ground, turn it on, and say: <say>We would like to measure the environmental noise levels. Is there a good place where I can put this measuring device where your child cannot reach? The tablet only measures the environmental noise measures and not what you’re actually saying.</say>

- Point the video camera at the tablet
- Open the decibel meter application (the application immediately starts recording noise levels upon startup).
- Place device in the most central place in the home (e.g., living room).
- The microphone should be facing towards the room (e.g., away from walls) and propped up on the microphone stand so that it is **not** lying flat against the surface of the space.

### 3.2 One-Hour Natural Play Video

<insert example one-hour video here>

Point the video camera towards mom and say: <say>For the next hour, do anything you would typically do if I weren’t here. Try to ignore me as much as possible and I will stay out of the way. I will also try not to respond to you and [CHILD] so that he/she is not distracted. You can go anywhere in your home. You can play together or not. The idea is to capture what your typical day is like.</say>

- Note the time on the camera and ensure that you will be recording for an additional 60 minutes.
- Keep camera on the child at all times. Specifically, ensure that the child’s whole body is visible on camera. If mom is in frame, capture as much of her body as possible without compromising view of the child.
- Record in front or to the side of the child as much as possible.
- Do not zoom in.
- Remain at as far a distance as possible (~3 to 5 m, hugging the wall) so that the child is not distracted by your presence.
- Try not to interact with the child or make eye contact with the child. Just watch through the view finder of the camera.  

##### Shoes

* If child was wearing shoes during the recording, say “Could I get a close-up of the shoes [CHILD] has been wearing?”. Ask mom to remove the shoes, video-record the shoes after the session; take them off child and video the bottom, side, and top views. Zoom in with camera and comment on shoe type, heel (if any), and other observations.  
* If the child was _not_ wearing shoes during the one-hour recording, get a video of the shoes during the house walkthrough. The recording of the shoes must either be a part of the one-hour video or the house walkthrough video - we do not need a separate recording. Shoes can be found at the entrance if the family doesn’t wear them around the house. Or you can ask about shoes when you’re in the child’s room. Pick up both shoes and record the bottom, side, and top views. Zoom in with camera and comment on shoe type, heel (if any), and other observations.  

At the end of the one-hour recording, say: <say>Great, we are done with the one-hour recording!</say>  
With camera in hand (and still recording), walk over to where the tablet was placed, and hit the “save” button. Then stop the camera recording. Name the file with the participant ID and quit.



## 4. Video House Walk-through while measuring rooms

Say: <say>Now, we would like to see the space that [CHILD] gets to explore throughout the day. Please walk me through your home as I follow with a camera, and take measurements of the spaces. As we walk around, please show me where you keep any objects — toys, books, sippy cups, anything like that — that [CHILD] might interact with regularly. Please show me where you keep his/her clothes to give us an idea of the kinds of things he/she wears.</say>

Ensure that all of experimenter's personal items, recording equipment, yoga mat and toys for structured play are stored out of sight.  

Video capture tips:  

- Watch recording through camcorder screen to ensure that the view is not blurry or shaky  
- Move the camera slowly and walk slowly  
- A clear and steady view, free of blurriness and shakiness, is necessary for detailed coding of the home environment
- The laser measure device does not work against reflective surfaces (mirrors, glass walls, etc), so point to a non-reflective surface or measure from the reflective surface towards the opposite direction.

About room measurements:  

- You will measure all rooms in the house while you do the video walkthrough  
- A room is any space used by someone on a regular basis - bedrooms, kitchens, bathrooms, basements - they don't need to have windows  
- A room has to have a clear demarcation (e.g., a wall or an entry). A space is considered to be a room if it has a minimum of 3 walls.
- Do not measure laundry rooms
- If the room has a short divider (e.g., when a kitchen and a living room are divided by a counter), count as one big room and measure accordingly.

Steps:  

1. Pause at the entrance of the room.
2. Audibly name the room by its function (e.g., <say>This is where [CHILD] sleeps</say>).
3. First, get as much of the **Entire Room** in frame as possible. Keep the camera zoomed out and make sure to capture the ceiling and the floor of the room.
4. Next, pan the camera SLOWLY from **Left to Right**.
5. Then, pan the camera to **Floor**, name the different types of surfaces in the space (hardwood, plush carpet, thin rug, linoleum, tile, etc.), and then pan to the **Ceiling**.
6. Hold the camera in one hand while you take measurements of the room using the other. <br>
    - Turn measure on by pressing ON/DIST button. Make sure the laser beam is visible. <br> 
    - Measure wall to wall, lengthwise and widthwise. <br>
    - If a room has an odd or asymmetrical shape (i.e., any shape other than a rectangle or a square), measure the largest rectangle or square area of the room. <br>
    - Place the base of the laser flat on the wall, push ON/DIST againt to send the beam across the room (avoid moldings, door castings, reflective surfaces) <br>
    - Repeat the above for the second dimension (length or width) <br>
    - Focus camera on laser measure for each measure and read numbers out loud with units (e.g. <say>eight point five feet</say>) <br>
7. Ask parent if child spends time in each room: <say>Does [CHILD] spend any time in this room?</say>
8. Ask parent about child’s objects in the room: <say>Do you keep anything for [CHILD] in this room? (If yes) Would you mind showing me?</say>
9. **Ensure during the house walkthrough that the parent provides information on all of the following:**
    - *Children's Sleeping Arrangements.* <say>Please show me where [CHILD] typically sleeps.</say>
    - *Child’s Clothes.* <say>Please show me where you keep [CHILD]’s clothes.</say>
    - *Child’s Shoes.* <say>Please show me where you keep [CHILD]’s shoes.</say>
    - *Child’s Books.* <say>Please show me where you keep [CHILD]’s books.</say>
    - *Child’s Toys.* <say>Please show me where you keep [CHILD]’s toys.</say>
10. Film the **Location** of the storage space (drawer, toy chest, cabinet) in clear context of the rest of the room. Then, SLOWLY and CLEARLY film the **Contents** of the storage space to show what is inside of it, zooming in if needed. (Overhead view for bed, crib, drawers, toy chest, etc.; Zoomed in side view for cabinet, closet, bookshelf, etc.)
11. Do ** *NOT* ** turn off the camera when walking to next room.
11. Walk SLOWLY.

</video>
</div>

Say: <say>Now I would like you to play with your child for about 5 minutes with these toys. We always clean these toys before and after each visit. I have a mat that I’m going to ask you to sit on. Where’s a good place for me to put it?</say>

Place the mat on a clearing on the floor.

Say: <say>Please sit next to [CHILD] on this mat. I’ll give you a set of toys. Please play with [CHILD] however you like for 5 minutes.</say>

* If the child is playing with a different toy before the recording, ask mom if she can put the toy away.
* Hand tote bag with toys to mom.
* Record so that the child and mother’s entire bodies - faces, eyes, and hands - are captured. If child stands up, make sure to capture the feet. If you are in a position from which you cannot capture the full face and both eyes, position yourself to capture a profile view.
* If child and mom are separated at any point, focus camera on child.
* Use timer on camera to time engagement.
* After 5 minutes, say “Great job! We can now move on to the questionnaires.”
* If the child is still playing with the toys after 5 minutes, let the child play and continue on to the questionnaires.
